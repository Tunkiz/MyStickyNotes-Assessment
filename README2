I was unable to set the notes to able to be editable
-The steps that i would take would be setting the notes entities to be editable and updating the entities of the notes in the database,
so when the page refreshes the edited entities stays the same.

I was unable to add a click anywhere on the scream function to add a sticky note at that position
-Getting the mouse positin(x,y) by using onmousedown and using it on the padding of the notes div element will place the note at the position of the mouse.
-The sticky note must be stored together with it postion(x,y)
